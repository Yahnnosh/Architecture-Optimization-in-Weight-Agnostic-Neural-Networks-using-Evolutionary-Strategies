#Project Plan

**Week 0**: Proof of concept
- **Nando**: Spatial Oriented Neural Networks
- **Janosch**: Weight Agnostic Neural Networks

**Week 1**: Proof of concept (extended)
- **Nando**: Spatial Oriented Neural Network (proof of concept)
- **Janosch**: Weight Agnostic Neural Network (multi-layer)
  - *Under development*:
    - ~~_(Much) faster evaluation -> computation time_~~
    - ~~_Multi-layer?_~~
    - _Convolutional weight (a-)gnostic NN?_
    - ~~_Weight gnostic NN?_~~
    - _Dynamic mutation rate?_
    - _Dynamic population size?_
