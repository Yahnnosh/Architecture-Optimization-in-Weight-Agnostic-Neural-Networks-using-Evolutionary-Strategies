# Automatic Machine Learning Using Genetic Algorithm
This project proposes an algorithm used for training a neural network (architecture and hyperparameters), evaluated on the MNIST dataset.
A genetic algorithm trains a fixed neural network architecture, while a second algorithm (Nelder-mead) optimizes the architecture and the parameters used in the genetic algorithm.
