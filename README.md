# Mind Map
- ~~_(Much) faster evaluation -> computation time_~~
- ~~_Multi-layer NN_~~
- ~~_Weight gnostic NN?_~~
- _Number of layers mutable -> speciation_
- _Convolutional layers_
- ~~_Lots of activation functions_~~
- _Activation function by neuron_
- ~~_Row wise (neuron wise) crossover_~~
- _Dynamic mutation rate_
- _Dynamic population size_
- ~~_Crossover rate_~~
- ~~_Subset (of X_test) evaluation_~~ -> effect negligable
- _GA parameter tuning_ -> e.g. bayesian optimization, Nelder-mead?
