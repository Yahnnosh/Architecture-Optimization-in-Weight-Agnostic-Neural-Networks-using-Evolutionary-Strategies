# Mind Map

- _Number of layers mutable_
- _Convolutional layers_
- _Activation function by neuron_
- _Row wise (neuron wise) crossover_
- _Dynamic mutation rate_
- _Dynamic population size_

# Project Plan

**Week 0**: Proof of concept
- **Nando**: Spatial Oriented Neural Networks
- **Janosch**: Weight Agnostic Neural Networks

**Week 1**: Proof of concept (extended)
- **Nando**: Spatial Oriented Neural Network (proof of concept)
- **Janosch**: Weight Agnostic Neural Network (multi-layer)
  - *Under development*:
    - ~~_(Much) faster evaluation -> computation time_~~
    - ~~_Multi-layer?_~~
    - ~~_Weight gnostic NN?_~~
